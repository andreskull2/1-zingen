<h1 align="center">App Landing Page â€“ Training Project</h1>

<p align="center">
  This project is a fully responsive marketing landing page for <strong>Zingen</strong>, a karaoke app. It was developed as part of the Rocketseat Full Stack training program, serving as one of the practical exercises that integrates core web design and development concepts.
</p>

<p align="center">
  This version, however, marks a turning point in my learning journey. After completing the initial implementation by closely following the instructorâ€™s guidance, I realized the page didnâ€™t render properly on my iOS device (version 15.8.4). That issue really bothered me â€” so I decided to rebuild the entire project from scratch to understand what was going wrong and how to fix it.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Throughout the process, I deepened my understanding of modern CSS â€” especially media queries, advanced selectors, and nesting. I learned, for instance, how a single poorly written selector could affect the entire layout. That kind of detail challenged me for days until I finally nailed the solution.

<p align="center">
  This rewrite not only fixed the layout and compatibility issues but also gave me a much stronger foundation in writing modular, scalable CSS with clear structure and purpose.
