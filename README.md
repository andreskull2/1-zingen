<h1 align="center"> App landing page - Training project </h1>
<p align="center">
This project involves the development of a complete and fully responsive marketing landing page for Zingen, a karaoke app. It is part of the Full Stack training program and was designed as one of the practical specialization exercises, integrating fundamental concepts of web design and development.

However, this version of the project represents an important milestone in my learning journey. After completing the first implementation by strictly following the instructor's guidance, I noticed that the page didn’t render properly on my iOS device running version 15.8.4. That issue bothered me a lot, and I decided to rewrite the project from scratch to truly understand what was going wrong and how to fix it.
<p>
<p align="center">
Throughout this process, I deepened my understanding of modern CSS — especially media queries, advanced selectors, and nesting. I discovered, for example, how a poorly specified selector in a stylesheet could affect the entire layout — and it was exactly that kind of detail that challenged me for days until I finally found the right solution.

This rewrite not only solved the compatibility and layout issues but also gave me a much stronger grasp of how to organize styles in a clear, modular, and scalable way.
